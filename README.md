# Multiclass-Image-Classification

A Multiclass Image Classification project using Convolutional Neural Network in Keras and Tensorflow.

## Dataset

The dataset was divided into two phase: <br>

1- <strong>Training Phase</strong>: The dataset consists of 2330 images from 6 different categories where 1864 images were used for the training while 466 were used for validation. Dataset can be accessed through the link given below:<br>
